# Interleave-Division-Multiple-Access
 Interleave Division Multiple Access (IDMA) is one of the proposed non-orthogonal multiple access schemes for the future 5th generation (5G) mobile networks air interface. The project aims at simulating the system performance in different channel conditions. A comparison is also made between the propsed system and Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access (DS-CDMA).
